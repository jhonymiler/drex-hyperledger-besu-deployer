# drex-hyperledger-besu-deployer

## Overview
The `drex-hyperledger-besu-deployer` is a tool designed to streamline the process of building and deploying nodes for a Hyperledger Besu network. This tool is inspired by Drex, a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) infrastructure from Brazil. It enables users to deploy a similar network in seconds.

## Requirements
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- A bash shell environment for running scripts (available on Linux, Mac, and Windows via Git Bash or similar)

## Features
- Fast setup and deployment of Hyperledger Besu nodes.
- User-friendly interface for specifying the number of nodes.
- Automatic key generation for each node.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the cloned directory and run the setup script.


## Installation
To install the `drex-hyperledger-besu-deployer`, follow these steps:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open a Linux, Mac, or Windows terminal (Windows users can use Git Bash or a similar bash shell).
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `install.sh` script.
4. Run the installation script with the following command:
   ```bash
   sh install.sh
   ```
This script will set up everything you need to get started.

## Dockerfile
```Dockerfile
FROM hyperledger/besu:latest

# Copy necessary scripts or configuration files
COPY qbftConfigFile.json /qbftConfigFile.json

# Set the entrypoint to Besu
ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/besu/bin/besu"]

## Setup Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check for Docker installation and running status
if ! command -v docker &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Error: Docker is not installed. Please install Docker and retry."
    exit 1
fi

if ! docker info &> /dev/null; then
    echo "Error: Docker is not running. Please start Docker and retry."
    exit 1
fi

echo "Success: Docker is installed and running."

# Define a function to generate keys with Besu
generate_keys() {
    # Additional script commands go here...
}

# Main script to configure and set up nodes
# Additional setup commands go here...

echo "Setup Complete: All configuration files have been created."
```

## Configuration
Adjust the `genesis.json` file and other necessary settings to align with your specific network requirements. This step is crucial for tailoring the deployment to your desired Hyperledger Besu network configuration.

## Usage
Once the setup is complete, you can launch your Hyperledger Besu network with the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Be a Node - CBDC Simulator
By using this setup, you can emulate the operation of a node in a CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) network. This provides an immersive and educational experience, closely mirroring the functionality of the Drex infrastructure.
